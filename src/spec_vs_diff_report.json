However, the required generated image assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` are not present in this diff (no files added), and the message-view helper text about a ~31s video is not evidenced in the provided truncation.",

      "requirement": "Add static parchment/paper texture and subtle decorative accent artwork as generated image assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated`, and reference them directly in the React UI.",
      "reason": "The diff shows zero added files and no `frontend/public/assets/generated/*` assets were added, yet CSS references `/assets/generated/parchment-texture.dim_2000x2000.png`. This indicates the required image assets are missing from the change set.",
